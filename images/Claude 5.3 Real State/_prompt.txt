Create a photorealistic architectural visualization of a modern sustainable home exterior at dusk. The two-story home features floor-to-ceiling windows, a living green roof, exposed timber beams, and a wrap-around deck. Position the home on a gentle hillside with native landscaping and mature oak trees. The sky shows dramatic sunset colors reflected in the large windows. Include subtle landscape lighting illuminating the pathway and accent lighting on the facade. A Tesla is parked in the driveway. The overall feeling should be "dream home meets environmental consciousness" — the kind of image that makes people immediately want to know the asking price.
