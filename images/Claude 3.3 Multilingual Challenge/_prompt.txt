Create a travel poster for Tokyo that includes text in three languages. The main headline "TOKYO" should be in large, modern sans-serif at the top. Below it, include "東京" (Japanese characters) in traditional calligraphy style. Add a French tagline: "Où tradition rencontre innovation" in elegant script. The background should show Tokyo Tower at sunset with cherry blossoms in the foreground. At the bottom, include "VISIT JAPAN 2025" with a small Japanese flag icon.
