Create a single 4-panel image showing the same person at four different stages of life:

1) Age 8 – a curious kid reading a science book on the floor.
2) Age 22 – a university student coding late at night with a laptop and coffee.
3) Age 40 – a professional giving a talk on AI at a modern conference.
4) Age 70 – an older version of the same person teaching a child how to paint.

The person should clearly be the same individual in all panels: same face structure, eye color, and overall vibe, just aging naturally. 
Style: ultra-photorealistic but slightly cinematic, soft depth of field.
Lighting: warm, believable indoor lighting in every panel.
Layout: 4 equal vertical panels in one image, with subtle separators between them.
Aspect ratio: 16:9 overall.
