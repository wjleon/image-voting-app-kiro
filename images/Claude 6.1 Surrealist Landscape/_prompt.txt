Create a surrealist masterpiece in the style of Salvador Dalí meets digital art. A vast desert landscape where the sand is made of flowing clock faces, all melting and dripping upward toward a sky filled with floating eyeballs that serve as moons. In the center, a massive elephant with impossibly long, spindly legs made of human arms walks toward the horizon. Its shadow on the ground shows a completely different creature — a whale. The color palette shifts from warm amber and ochre in the foreground to impossible greens and purples in the distance. Include hyper-detailed textures that reward close inspection while maintaining dream-logic coherence in the overall composition.
