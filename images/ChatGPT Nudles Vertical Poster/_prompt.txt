Design a vertical poster for a fictional late-night ramen bar called 
"NEON NOODLES".

Requirements:
- The main headline text, perfectly readable: "NEON NOODLES"
- Subheadline text: "Open 11 PM – 4 AM • Cyber City District 7"
- A smaller tagline near the bottom: "Fuel for hackers, dreamers & night owls."

Visual style:
- Neon cyberpunk aesthetic with glowing signage and rain reflections.
- A steaming bowl of ramen as the focal illustration, with chopsticks and glowing broth.
- Color palette: deep purples, electric cyan, hot pink, accents of golden yellow.
- Composition: enough negative space around the main title so it can be clearly read in a thumbnail.

Aspect ratio: 4:5, optimized for social media posts.
