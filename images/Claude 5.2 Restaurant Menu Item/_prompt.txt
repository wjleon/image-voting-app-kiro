Create a mouth-watering food photography shot of a gourmet burger. The burger features: a brioche bun with sesame seeds, two thick wagyu beef patties, melted aged cheddar, caramelized onions, crispy bacon, arugula, and a special sauce dripping down the side. Steam rises from the patties. Position on a dark slate surface with artisanal pickles and truffle fries visible in the background (out of focus). Use dramatic top-down lighting with a slight backlight to create a halo effect. The style should match high-end restaurant marketing — editorial food photography quality.
