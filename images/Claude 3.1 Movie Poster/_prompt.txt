Create a cinematic movie poster for a sci-fi thriller called "NEURAL ECLIPSE." The title should be in large, chrome metallic 3D letters at the top of the image, glowing with cyan edges. Below the title: "In 2087, consciousness became currency." The background shows a futuristic cityscape at night with a massive holographic brain floating above the skyline. At the bottom, include credits in small text: "STARRING MAYA CHEN • DIRECTED BY ALEX RIVERA • A NEXUS FILMS PRODUCTION" and a release date "DECEMBER 2025" in a distinctive font. Include a PG-13 rating logo in the bottom corner.
