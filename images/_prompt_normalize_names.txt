I want to make all file naming consisten; so, do the following
1. rename all image names so it contains the following name structure
<parent-directory-name>-<model-name>-<seq>.<extension>
Where
<parent-directory-name> : is the name of parent folder -replace spaces with underscores-, for instance, Claude_2.1_Maya_Coorporate
<model-name> : is the name of the model, the only possible names are:
ByteDance
ChatGPT
Flux
Grok
Ideogram
Leonardo
Midjourney
NanoBananaPro
Qwen
Reve

Rename whatever you need to in order to match the format

<seq> : should be a natural number, if the folder contains 4 images, then there will be -1, -2, -3 and -4
<extension> : should be left as is, i.e., whatever the image extension is
