Create a hyper-realistic action figure in original packaging. The figure is a 46-year-old tech executive with short dark hair, wearing a navy blue suit and holding a tiny laptop. The packaging says "THE CTO" at the top in bold metallic letters, with a tagline "Comes with: Coffee Cup, Server Rack, Burnout Expression." The packaging should look like an authentic toy from the 80s with slight wear. Include a plastic window showing the figure, cardboard backing with fake "Ages 30+" warning, and a barcode at the bottom.
