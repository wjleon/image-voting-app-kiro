Create a moody cyberpunk noir scene. A lone figure in a long trenchcoat walks through a rain-soaked alley in Neo-Tokyo, 2089. Neon signs in Japanese characters reflect off wet pavement in pinks, blues, and greens. Steam rises from street vents. The figure's face is partially obscured by the brim of their hat, with only the glow of a cybernetic eye visible. In the background, towering megastructures disappear into smog, their windows creating a grid of light. Include flying vehicles as distant silhouettes. The atmosphere should feel like Blade Runner meets Ghost in the Shell — beautiful, melancholic, and slightly menacing.
