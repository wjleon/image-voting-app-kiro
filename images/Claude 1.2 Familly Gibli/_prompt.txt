Transform this scene into a Studio Ghibli animated masterpiece: A family of four (two adults, two children) having a picnic in a sunlit meadow. The father has a beard and glasses, the mother has long dark hair, the children are around 5 and 10 years old. Capture the whimsical Ghibli style with soft watercolor skies, detailed grass textures, gentle wind movement in hair and clothes, and the characteristic warm, nostalgic lighting of films like "My Neighbor Totoro." Add subtle magical elements — perhaps Totoro-like creatures peeking from behind distant trees, dust motes floating in sunbeams, and impossibly fluffy clouds.
