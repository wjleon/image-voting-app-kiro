Create a nostalgic 1990s mall studio portrait. Subject: A confident professional in their 40s with a slight smile. Background: The classic laser gradient background in purple, blue, and pink. Lighting: Soft, diffused studio lighting with a slight halo effect. Add lens flare, the characteristic soft focus of the era, and position the subject at a 3/4 angle. The overall aesthetic should scream "Sears Portrait Studio, 1992" with slight color shifting and that warm film grain quality.
