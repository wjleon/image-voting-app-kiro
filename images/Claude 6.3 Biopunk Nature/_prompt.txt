Imagine a world where technology and nature have merged. Create an image of a forest clearing where the trees have bioluminescent bark that pulses with data patterns. Mushrooms emit holographic spore clouds that display weather information. A deer stands at the center, its antlers replaced by delicate crystalline antenna arrays that pick up wireless signals. Fireflies are actually nano-drones maintaining the ecosystem. The lighting is otherworldly — a mix of natural moonlight and the soft glow of biological technology. The mood should feel magical and optimistic, like technology serving nature rather than replacing it.
