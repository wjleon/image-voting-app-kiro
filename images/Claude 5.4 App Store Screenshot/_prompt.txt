Create a polished app store screenshot for a meditation app. Show an iPhone 15 Pro at a slight angle displaying the app interface: a calming gradient from purple to blue, a centered lotus icon, the text "Begin Your Journey" in clean white sans-serif, and a "Start 7-Day Free Trial" button in soft gold. Around the phone, add floating 3D elements: translucent spheres, gentle wave patterns, and sparkle effects. The background should be a soft gradient that complements the app. The overall aesthetic should feel premium, calming, and conversion-optimized — like Calm or Headspace marketing.
